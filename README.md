The Ancestris software creates backup files, these have filenames of something like langrMooneyFamilyTree_20220323-112225.ged. I don't plan on keeping most of these around.

If you are interested in making changes, go ahead and submit a pull request for any changes you make (you'll need to clone the repository first).
